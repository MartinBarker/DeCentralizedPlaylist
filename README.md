# [DeCentralizedPlaylist](http://decentralizedplaylist.com/)
Maintain a playlist of your listening history accross multiple devices (mobile / laptop / desktop) and sources (YouTube / Soundcloud / Spotify / Files ... etc) continuously. 

## Problem:
Listening history / analysis differs per platform.
Platforms don't communicate with each other.
No concurrent single source of listening history accross all platforms and devices.

## Solution:
Android app: Catch, store, and send listening data from any audio source.
Chrome extension: Catch, store, and send listening data from any audio source for a desired tab.
MySQL server: Receive and store listening data, improve fields by calling DiscogsAPI to gather additional information, serve up analysis to the user.
